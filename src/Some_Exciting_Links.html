<h1>Page for Links</h1>

<body>

<p>This is an external web page for links to useful places for more learning:</p>

<a href="https://explainingcomputers.com/">ExplainingComputers.com</a><br>
<a href="https://explainingthefuture.com/">ExplainingtheFuture.com</a>

<p>This stupid asshole of a site is giving me a hard time by not bringing up links I have. Will deal with it later.</p>

<p>Nevermind lol it's all good.</p>
